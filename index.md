## Introduction

My name is **Michael Turco**, and this ePortfolio is my capstone project for CS-499 at SNHU. I'll be creating a professional and polished artifact through three different categories of enhancements, and showcase the skills I've learned while attending SNHU. I plan to be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science / Software Engineering in December 2025!

## Overview of my Artifact

The artifact I selected for all three enhancements is my full-stack mobile application called **Track My Weight** from CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original app lets the user create an account and login to a local MySQL database, record new weight entries, and view their weight history in a scrollable list.

I originally completed the first version of the app in February 2025, and chose it for this portfolio because it provided a strong foundation and plenty of opportunities for meaningful improvement. Through the **three enhancements described below**, I turned this project into a much more polished, professional, and user-ready application that I intend to publish on the app store.

## Informal Code Review Video

In this video, I walk through the original version of my artifact in Android Studio. This covers the **Track My Weight** appp, and I evaluate the current state of the code, such as coding style and errors, and I also outline the changes I plan to implement across all three enhancement categories.

## Course Outcomes

These are the **five** course outcomes that I will be demonstrating mastery in through my project.

1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, migitage design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
