## Introduction

My name is **Michael Turco**, and this ePortfolio is my capstone project for CS-499 at SNHU. I'll be creating a professional and polished artifact through three different categories of enhancements, and showcase the skills I've learned while attending SNHU. I plan to be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science / Software Engineering in December 2025!

## Overview of my Artifact

The artifact I selected for all three enhancements is my full-stack mobile application called **Track My Weight** from CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original app lets the user create an account and login to a local MySQL database, record new weight entries, and view their weight history in a scrollable list.

I originally completed the first version of the app in February 2025, and chose it for this portfolio because it provided a strong foundation and plenty of opportunities for meaningful improvement. Through the **three enhancements described below**, I turned this project into a much more polished, professional, and user-ready application that I intend to publish on the app store.

## Informal Code Review Video

In this video, I walk through the original version of my artifact in Android Studio. This covers the **Track My Weight** appp, and I evaluate the current state of the code, such as coding style and errors, and I also outline the changes I plan to implement across all three enhancement categories.
