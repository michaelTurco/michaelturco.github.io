## Overview of my Artifact

The artifact I selected for all three enhancements is my full-stack mobile application called **Track My Weight** from CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The original app lets the user create an account and login to a local MySQL database, record new weight entries, and view their weight history in a scrollable list.

I originally completed the first version of the app in February 2025, and chose it for this portfolio because it provided a strong foundation and plenty of opportunities for meaningful improvement. Through the **three enhancements described below**, I turned this project into a much more polished, professional, and user-ready application that I intend to publish on the app store.
